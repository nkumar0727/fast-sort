# fast-sort

## Overview
NOTE: This repo is currently being modified with no specific deadline in mind, as its contents are very unorganized.

As part of an undergraduate operating systems class at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I found an interesting assignment given to past students. The goal was to create a fast, single threaded sorting program for specific text file format.

I have decided to try my hand on it, as I think it's a good opporunity to develop understanding in the following concepts:
+ algorithm analysis
+ data structures
+ cache awareness
+ c programming
